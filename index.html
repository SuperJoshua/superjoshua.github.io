         Hi. This index page is pretty sparse, on purpose. I've read that hotlinking is generally considered rude -- especially
         when it's done without permission. Would it still be be rude, with permission? I suppose that depends on the nature of the
         permission giver and the interpretation of the permission receiver. Anyway, it's hardly rude if I link to my stuff. Probably.
         And that's what this page is for -- a place to store stuff that I can link to during my web development travels.
